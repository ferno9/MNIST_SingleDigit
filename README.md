It was my first time using hugging spaces and i didnt know how to properly convert the drawn digit into the 28x28 input size for the CNN using the premade Sketchpad functionality.

# MNIST_SingleDigit
A Simple CNN trained on The MNIST Handwritten dataset.
This project was created during the time i was learning about CNNs. Using a relative simple CNN Architecture, the model was able to achive a 99.2 % accuracy rate.

Tools : Pytorch, Fastai
